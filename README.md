# LEAF Token Sample Project

Project build with Bootstrap5 for frontend, Solidity for backend and Truffle (Ganache) for Unit testing. 

## What's Inside :

- LEAF Token Smart Contract built all the way from scratch. 
- LEAF Pre-Sale Smart Contract build from scratch.
- LEAF Token ICO Website built using Bootstrap 5
- jQuery used for connecting frontend with backend.
